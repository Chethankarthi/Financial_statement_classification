1. Overview:

This report provides an overview of the financial statement classification system developed for [Client Name].

2. Objective:

The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically classifying financial statements into different categories based on their content.

3. Data Extraction:

The data used for training and testing the model were extracted from HTML files containing financial statements. The following categories were considered:

Income Statements
Balance Sheets
Cash Flows
Notes
Others

4. Data Preprocessing:

Before training the model, the following preprocessing steps were applied to the text data extracted from the HTML files:

Tokenization
Removal of stopwords
Lemmatization
Vectorization using TF-IDF

5. Model Training:

A Logistic Regression model was trained using the preprocessed text data and TF-IDF vectors. The model achieved an accuracy of [Insert Accuracy] on the test dataset.

6. Evaluation:

The performance of the model was evaluated using the following metrics:
